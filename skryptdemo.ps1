    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates a bootable VHD(X) based on Windows 7 or Windows 8 installation media.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates a bootable VHD(X) based on Windows 7 or Windows 8 installation media.

    .PARAMETER SourcePath
        The complete path to the WIM or ISO file that will be converted to a Virtual Hard Disk.
        The ISO file must be valid Windows installation media to be recognized successfully.

    .PARAMETER VHDPath
        The name and path of the Virtual Hard Disk to create.
        Omitting this parameter will create the Virtual Hard Disk is the current directory, (or,
        if specified by the -WorkingDirectory parameter, the working directory) and will automatically 
        name the file in the following format:

        <build>.<revision>.<architecture>.<branch>.<timestamp>_<skufamily>_<sku>_<language>.<extension>
        i.e.:
        8250.0.amd64chk.winmain_win8beta.120217-1520_client_professional_en-us.vhd(x)

    .PARAMETER WorkingDirectory
        Specifies the directory where the VHD(X) file should be generated.  
        If specified along with -VHDPath, the -WorkingDirectory value is ignored.
        The default value is the current directory ($pwd).

    .PARAMETER SizeBytes
        The size of the Virtual Hard Disk to create.
        For fixed disks, the VHD(X) file will be allocated all of this space immediately.
        For dynamic disks, this will be the maximum size that the VHD(X) can grow to.
        The default value is 40GB.

    .PARAMETER VHDFormat
        Specifies whether to create a VHD or VHDX formatted Virtual Hard Disk.
        The default is VHD.

    .PARAMETER VHDType
        Specifies whether to create a fixed (fully allocated) VHD(X) or a dynamic (sparse) VHD(X).
        The default is dynamic.

    .PARAMETER UnattendPath
        The complete path to an unattend.xml file that can be injected into the VHD(X).

    .PARAMETER Edition
        The name or image index of the image to apply from the WIM.

    .PARAMETER Passthru
        Specifies that the full path to the VHD(X) that is created should be
        returned on the pipeline.

    .PARAMETER BCDBoot
        By default, the version of BCDBOOT.EXE that is present in \Windows\System32
        is used by Convert-WindowsImage.  If you need to specify an alternate version,
        use this parameter to do so.

    .PARAMETER VHDPartitionStyle
        Partition style (MBR or GPT) for the newly created disk (VHDX or VHD). By default
        it will be partitioned with MBR partition style, used for older BIOS-based computers
        and Generation 1 Virtual Machines in Hyper-V. For modern UEFI-based computers
        and Generation 2 Virtual Machines, GPT partition layout is required.

    .PARAMETER BCDinVHD
        Specifies the purpose of the VHD(x). Use NativeBoot to skip cration of BCD store
        inside the VHD(x). Use VirtualMachine (or do not specify this option) to ensure
        the BCD store is created inside the VHD(x).

    .PARAMETER Driver
        Full path to driver(s) (.inf files) to inject to the OS inside the VHD(x).

    .PARAMETER ExpandOnNativeBoot
        Specifies whether to expand the VHD(x) to its maximum suze upon native boot.
        The default is True. Set to False to disable expansion.

    .PARAMETER RemoteDesktopEnable
        Enable Remote Desktop to connect to the OS inside the VHD(x) upon provisioning.
        Does not include Windows Firewall rules (firewall exceptions). The default is False.

    .PARAMETER Feature
        Enables specified Windows Feature(s). Note that you need to specify the Internal names
        understood by DISM and DISM CMDLets (e.g. NetFx3) instead of the "Friendly" names
        from Server Manager CMDLets (e.g. NET-Framework-Core).

    .PARAMETER Package
        Injects specified Windows Package(s). Accepts path to either a directory or individual
        CAB or MSU file.

    .PARAMETER ShowUI
        Specifies that the Graphical User Interface should be displayed.

    .PARAMETER EnableDebugger
        Configures kernel debugging for the VHD(X) being created.
        EnableDebugger takes a single argument which specifies the debugging transport to use.
        Valid transports are: None, Serial, 1394, USB, Network, Local.

        Depending on the type of transport selected, additional configuration parameters will become
        available.

        Serial:
            -ComPort   - The COM port number to use while communicating with the debugger.
                         The default value is 1 (indicating COM1).
            -BaudRate  - The baud rate (in bps) to use while communicating with the debugger.
                         The default value is 115200, valid values are:
                         9600, 19200, 38400, 56700, 115200
            
        1394:
            -Channel   - The 1394 channel used to communicate with the debugger.
                         The default value is 10.

        USB:
            -Target    - The target name used for USB debugging.
                         The default value is "debugging".

        Network:
            -IPAddress - The IP address of the debugging host computer.
            -Port      - The port on which to connect to the debugging host.
                         The default value is 50000, with a minimum value of 49152.
            -Key       - The key used to encrypt the connection.  Only [0-9] and [a-z] are allowed.
            -nodhcp    - Prevents the use of DHCP to obtain the target IP address.
            -newkey    - Specifies that a new encryption key should be generated for the connection.
   
    .EXAMPLE
        .\Convert-WindowsImage.ps1 -SourcePath D:\foo\install.wim -Edition Professional -WorkingDirectory D:\foo

        This command will create a 40GB dynamically expanding VHD in the D:\foo folder.
        The VHD will be based on the Professional edition from D:\foo\install.wim,
        and will be named automatically.

    .EXAMPLE
        .\Convert-WindowsImage.ps1 -SourcePath D:\foo\Win7SP1.iso -Edition Ultimate -VHDPath D:\foo\Win7_Ultimate_SP1.vhd

        This command will parse the ISO file D:\foo\Win7SP1.iso and try to locate
        \sources\install.wim.  If that file is found, it will be used to create a 
        dynamically-expanding 40GB VHD containing the Ultimate SKU, and will be 
        named D:\foo\Win7_Ultimate_SP1.vhd

    .EXAMPLE
        .\Convert-WindowsImage.ps1 -SourcePath D:\foo\install.wim -Edition Professional -EnableDebugger Serial -ComPort 2 -BaudRate 38400

        This command will create a VHD from D:\foo\install.wim of the Professional SKU.
        Serial debugging will be enabled in the VHD via COM2 at a baud rate of 38400bps.
